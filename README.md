Our aim in this project is to incorporate this algorithm into hardware devices which capture human motion specifically for the elderly, or people who require aid while walking. 
In case of an emergency such as a fall, the algorithm detects a change in posture in a matter of seconds and automatically sends an alert to the preconfigured emergency contacts of said person.
Deep learning-based pose estimation models, such as MoveNet, have been widely used in medical applications due to their high accuracy and real-time performance. These models can process video feeds and detect human poses frame by frame, enabling the development of advanced healthcare systems.
In summary, pose detection algorithms have shown great potential in medical research and healthcare, providing valuable insights into various medical conditions and rehabilitation. 
The development of deep learning-based pose estimation models has further enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of these algorithms, enabling the implementation of advanced healthcare systems.
